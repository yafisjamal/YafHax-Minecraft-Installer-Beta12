Overview
The Minecraft Installer is a single-file console installer designed to detect your environment, download required runtime components, perform authentication handshakes, and install the selected Minecraft edition with default settings optimized for Windows. The installer supports both Java and Bedrock editions as well as the Minecraft Legends demo, and it can perform environment checks and basic troubleshooting automatically.
The installer is built for use from the Windows command prompt or PowerShell and exposes both an interactive console flow and non-interactive command-line switches for scripted deployments.
